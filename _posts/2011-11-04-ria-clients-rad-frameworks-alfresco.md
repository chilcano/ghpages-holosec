Some days ago I saw a post on the LinkedIn's Alfresco forums asking ['Which front end framework is Generally used with Alfresco?'](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Which-front-end-framework-is-663827.S.69732274?view=&srchtype=discussedNews&gid=663827&item=69732274&type=member&trk=eml-anet_dig-b_pd-ttl-cn&ut=2MCRzVZGv0CAU1), for this reason I started to research and test them and discovered with joy that the trend is to use lightweight frameworks capable of creating rich interfaces quickly. Well here I put the review: Because I started to carefully review and discovered with joy that the trend is to use lightweight frameworks capable of creating rich interfaces quickly. Well here I put the review:

  
## I. What is a client for Alfresco ECM ?

  
A client for Alfresco is any webapp or desktop app that consumes the Alfresco's services, this client app can be created with Alfresco's standard framework or with third party frameworks.

  
Several endusers want always customize traditional and existing Alfresco's web clients, because these do not fit its requeriments.  
  
Then, they quickly seek to modify existing Alfresco's webclient and if this is not possible, then seek a tool (framework) to build a desktop or client from scratch.

  
[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="429" caption="How to client applications can be connected to Alfresco ECM"][![How to client applications can be connected to Alfresco ECM]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ria_clients_alfresco_rev1.png)](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2961879/blog20111104_riaclientsalfresco/ria_clients_alfresco_rev1.png)[/caption]

  
What are the main reasons why you need to modify Alfresco's webclients or create new ones?  
  
Well, there are several reasons:

  
  

  * The technology stack in the company is not Java.
  

  * Is very difficult to make changes. Although there is much online information available on how to make customizations to Alfresco Explorer and Alfresco Share.
  

  * Make changes in existing webapp are not supported.
  

  * UI (look&feel) is not aligned to corporate graphical style.
  

  * Alfresco's content must be delivered for any devices: iPad, Android tablet, PC, etc.
  

  * ... or simply, everybody has different requirements.
  

  
Well, this post will review existing initiatives, RIA, RDA (Rich Desktop App) and RAD frameworks for developing clients for Alfresco ECM.

\- Lucene Search for Limited Result Query's

## IV. Conclusions

  * This review concludes that the trend is to use existing products (ifresco, Drupal, OpenAtrium, Liferay, ....) enabling rapid integration with Alfresco services.
  * The second option is to create RIA applications from scratch, and quickly, taking advantage of existing metaframeworks, we can see in doCASU, ExtAlf, AWPr, FlexSpace, etc.., The fact that they have started as a proof of concept and then have become standalone products confirms this trend.
  * You can download a resume table with all features of each product reviewed from here.
