<p>Yes, it is my first post and i hope that it will not be last one. So far I published my thoughts in Spanish and in a <a href="http://intix.info/">static web page</a>, and it was boring.. now, i should be more funny for reaching a wider audience.</p>
<p>Well, here are going to publish some thoughts such as Quality, Systems Thinking, Holism, Trust, Security, Usability and different things without relation.. apparently.</p>
<p>Regards!</p>
