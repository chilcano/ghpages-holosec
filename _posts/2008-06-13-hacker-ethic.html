<p>Six years ago I read the "<strong>The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of Information Age</strong>" book, by <a title="Pekka Himanen" href="http://www.pekkahimanen.org">Pekka Himanen</a> (this book is a collaborative work between Pekka Himanen, Linus Torvalds and Manuel Castells -philosopher, hacker and sociologist, respectively) and understood that <strong>Hacker Ethic</strong> is a new is a new morality that defies the Protestant work ethic, outlined nearly a century ago <strong>Max Weber</strong> in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic">The protrestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism</a>" articuled.</p>

<p>Now, Pekka Himanen articulates how hackers represent a new, opposing spirit for the information age. Underlying hackers' technical creations are the hacker values that produced them and that challenge us all.</p>
<p>The Hacker Ethic values promote passionate and freely rhythmed work; the belief that individuals can create great things by joining forces in imaginative ways; and the need to maintain our existing ethical ideals, such as privacy and equality, in our new, increasingly technologized society</p>
