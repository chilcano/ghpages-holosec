The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report for this blog.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2012-emailteaser.png)](http://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2013/annual-report/)
Here's an excerpt:
> The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about **33,000** times in 2013. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 12 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.
Here's some images:

**Observations** :
  1. My post comparing free/open source BPM tools of 2011 is still the most visited. Think I should update it.
  2. My post on Private Cloud "lowcost" with Proxmox was the most visited in 2013 per day. I will continue writing about IaaS and PaaS, and specially on [WSO2 AppFactory](http://wso2.com/cloud/app-factory/ "WSO2 AppFactory"), [WSO2 Private PaaS (Apache Stratos)](http://wso2.com/cloud/private-paas/ "WSO2 Private PaaS") and [RedHat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/ "RedHat Openshift").
  3. The referring site were: soapUI.org (my swiss-army-knife, although Mac OS X has an unfriendly UI), bonitasoft.org (my posts are used as marketing material, I think I should charge them for that :D ), konakart.com (an Java eCommerce platform to build small and big Shots, a tool really impressive because it is easily integrable and suitable for any requirement).
  4. Total visitors of the countries of South America (ca. 4800) is higher than the U.S., Europe and India. For this reason, the next year I will write more in Spanish.
  5. What about of WSO2 ?. Nothing, because It is necessary more diffusion and more content oriented to beginners.

**Conclusions** :
Just some keywords for this 2014:
  * Service Oriented Integration (SOI) and terms related as SOA, API, ESB, etc.
  * Platform as an Service (PaaS) and usecases as BigData, DevOps, Productivity, etc.
  * Security of Information and over Business Transactions
  * And ECM, Portal, BPM, ERP, CRM, eCommerce free/open source and [WSO2 Cloud Connectors](http://wso2.com/library/blog-post/2013/12/wso2-esb-4.8.0-introducing-cloud-connectors/ "WSO2 Cloud Connectors") (for cloud-cloud and cloud-enterprise integration)

**And finally, here two links to predictions for 2014:**

Forrester Top Technology Trends for 2014 And Beyond (by Peter High)  
http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2013/11/25/forrester-top-technology-trends-for-2014-and-beyond/
Las 10 tendencias tecnológicas para la empresa en 2014, según Gartner (by Esther Macías, in Spanish)  
http://www.ticbeat.com/tecnologias/las-10-tendencias-tecnologicas-para-la-empresa-en-2014-segun-gartner/
In conclusion the keywords are: Mobile and Apps, [Cloud Architecture](http://blog.cobia.net/cobiacomm/2013/10/21/gartner-recognizes-cloud-architecture-as-a-trend/ "Cloud Architecture"), API (APIs become digital glue, before was SOA/SOI), Business Intelligence Platforms, “Trust” and “identity” get a rethink and IT becomes an agile service broker (or fades away).
