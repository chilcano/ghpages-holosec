By Wikipedia:

  
> The **Protestant work ethic** , sometimes called the **Puritan work ethic** , is a [Calvinist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism "Calvinism") value emphasizing the necessity of constant labor in a person's calling as a sign of personal [salvation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation "Salvation"). [Protestants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism") beginning with [Martin Luther](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") had reconceptualised work as a duty in the world for the benefit of the individual and society as a whole. The [Catholic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism "Catholicism") idea of [good works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_grace#Tension_between_grace_and_works_in_the_New_Testament "Divine grace") was transformed into an obligation to work diligently as a sign of grace.
