A Wikipedia definition is:

  


>   
>  **Holism** (from ὅλος holos, a Greek word meaning all, entire, total) is the idea that all the properties of a given system (biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic, etc.) cannot be determined or explained by its component parts alone. Instead, the system as a whole determines in an important way how the parts behave.  
> 

  


In other words, **Holism** is a property of any **System**. But what is **Systems**? Wikipedia says:

  


>   
>  **System** is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole.  
> 

  


Then, **Holism** could be used as an **approach** to understand the reality or abstraction. No?. Yes!.  
  


  


A map-printed is a **system** , in this case it represents a specific geography/location (reality). Its elements or parts are: paths, orientation, size/scale, blocks, streets, traffic signs, etc.  
  
Commonly, this map-printed is called **model**.

  


A PC is other example of system. In Software Engineering a Database Server is a set of elements as PC-server, DDBB engine, tables, rows, columns, metadata, data, constrains, etc. A representation of the Database Server could be a **Entity-Relation model**.

The **Global warming Problem** is other kind of _System_ and it is possible to get a model too . It is a complex problem because is a big-System with many element and unknow relationships beetwen its parts. There is not enough paper for drawing this model.

Well, Holism is an approach that help us to interpret a System.

  


Here a table that summarize all that a bit more clearly.
