Yes, I could get a **XO-1** and am very impressed by the **quality** Ultra mobile PC ([UMPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-Mobile_PC)).

  
[![My XO-1 OLPC]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2008_05mayo_02_unboxing_olpc-008.jpg)](http://holisticsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/20080502xo-1olpcsiku.jpg)  
  
<!-- more -->  
  
XO-1 is well thought out in every way:

  
  

  * Is **secure** , the Bitfrost approach gives a holistic security, from delivery of PC, first boot, authentication for childs, etc.
  

  * Is **usable** , with Sugar all software applications (aka Activities) does easy to learn.
  

  * Is **mobile** , has mesh wireless support, is no necessary get internet because its mobile ad-hoc networking is used to allow many machines to share Internet access from one connection. It has low-power consumption.
  

  * Is **Freee/Open Source** device, inclusive the Firmware/Bios is FOS, except the WIFI driver for mesh purposes.
  

  
The **specs** of my XO-1 are:

  
  

  * CPU: 433 MHz AMD Geode LX-700 at 0.8 watts, with integrated graphics controller
  

  * Display dual-mode 19.1 cm/7.5" diagonal TFT LCD 1200×900 (200 dpi).
  

  * 256 MB of Dual (DDR266) 133 MHz DRAM.
  

  * 1024 kB (1 MB) flash ROM with open-source [Open Firmware.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware "Open Firmware")
  

  * 1024 MB of SLC NAND flash memory.
  

  * Operating system: Fedora-based (Linux)
  

  * Connectivity: 802.11b/g /s wireless LAN, 3 USB 2.0 ports and MMC/SD card slot
  

  * Input: Keyboard (water proof), Touchpad, Microphone, built-in video Camera (640×480; 30 FPS)
  

  * Weight: LiFeP battery: 1.45 kg [3.2 pounds]; NiMH battery: 1.58 kg [3.5 pounds]
  

  
There are some things that should improve, for example:

  
  

  * There is not a Video-out port
  

  * Sound card is of poor quality
  

  * The touch-pad has a pointer jumper, this is a bug reported
  

  
Whatever, the XO-1's are fine for the purposes they were designed, [for the childs and learning](http://laptop.org/index.es.html).

  
I hope to continue my research and soon I will post other comment about of [XO-1 overclocking](http://xolaptophelp.com/index.php?topic=2389.0) and hacking.

  
Ah, the booting of my XO-1 took 80 seconds aprox. You can see it in this video:
