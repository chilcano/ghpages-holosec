Yes, it is my first post and i hope that it will not be last one. So far I published my thoughts in Spanish and in a [static web page](http://intix.info/), and it was boring.. now, i should be more funny for reaching a wider audience.
Well, here are going to publish some thoughts such as Quality, Systems Thinking, Holism, Trust, Security, Usability and different things without relation.. apparently.
Regards!
