This book is a complete guide to the use of Bonita BPM 5.x, shown its technical features and gives a practical use of BPMN in the construction of process-based applications.

Note that this is the first "book" of Bonita BPM, althought is for Bonita BPM 5.x, the philosophy of why Bonita BPM is a powerful tool for building applications and with integration capabilities are latent.

  
Greetings.
