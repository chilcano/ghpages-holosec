The log event management is a task very important when working with (Micro)services. If you collect-store-index all logs, then you will be able to create your business metrics (KPI). You only must understand what by collecting logs you have to use special tools with technical special requirements:  
* Huge amout of logs could transform in your `BigData` asset.  
* You have to collect and query your logs in real time if you think your Application is critical.  
* You have to `manage` in agile way the life cycle of your data (your logs), they are an asset very important for your Organization.

<!-- more -->

You should be agile, for this reason, [Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana](https://www.elastic.co) is the perfect Stack to do that in an agile way.  
Really, there are many tools out there, opensource, commercial, on-cloud, such as log.io, Clarity, rTail, Tailon, frontail, etc. In my opinion, for a development environment, the most simple, fresh and lightweight tool is rTail (http://rtail.org), with rTail I can collect different log files, track and visualize them from a Browser in real time. rTail is very easy to use, just install NodeJS and deploy rTail application and you will be ready to send any type of traces to Browser directly avoiding store/persist logs, index and parse/filter them.  
Well, this first blog post I will explain how to use ELK to collect, store and view the different log event of WSO2 ESB, API Manager, DSS, GREG and Wiremock.

## Part I: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### 1\. Starting with ELK Docker Container
 **1) Prepare the ELK container**
We gonna use an existing Docker Image with ELK created by [SÃ©bastien Pujadas](https://github.com/spujadas) `(http://elk-docker.readthedocs.org)` previously configured ready to be used. This Docker Image contains:  
\- Elasticsearch (version 2.1.1)  
\- Logstash (version 2.1.1)  
\- Kibana (version 4.3.1)
Then, let's do it. Start the Docker daemon and login Docker Hub:
```sh  
$ docker login  
Username (chilcano):  
WARNING: login credentials saved in /Users/Chilcano/.docker/config.json  
Login Succeeded
$ docker pull sebp/elk  
Using default tag: latest

Status: Downloaded newer image for sebp/elk:latest  
```
 **2) Run the container**
```sh  
$ docker run -p 5601:5601 -p 9200:9200 -p 5044:5044 -p 5000:5000 -it --name elk sebp/elk

```
**3) Check the status of ELK in the running container**
In other Terminal/Shell execute the next:
```sh  
$ docker-machine ls  
NAME ACTIVE DRIVER STATE URL SWARM ERRORS  
default - virtualbox Running tcp://192.168.99.100:2376  
machine-dev - virtualbox Stopped  
machine-test - virtualbox Stopped
$ docker-machine env default  
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"  
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"  
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/Chilcano/.docker/machine/machines/default"  
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="default"  

# Run this command to configure your shell:  

# eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
$ eval "$(docker-machine env default)"
$ docker ps  
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES  
788b97b04e9b sebp/elk "/usr/local/bin/start" 9 minutes ago Up 9 minutes 0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5044->5044/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5601->5601/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 9300/tcp elk  
```
The ports opened are:
  * 5601 (Kibana web interface).
  * 9200 (Elasticsearch JSON interface).
  * 5044 (Logstash Beats interface, receives logs from Beats such as Filebeat).
  * 5000 (Logstash Lumberjack interface, receives logs from Logstash forwarders).
**4) Check Elasticsearch server**
```sh  
$ curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla" -H "Origin: http://example.com" -i 192.168.99.100:9200  
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8  
Content-Length: 313
{  
"name" : "Zero",  
"cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",  
"version" : {  
"number" : "2.1.1",  
"build_hash" : "40e2c53a6b6c2972b3d13846e450e66f4375bd71",  
"build_timestamp" : "2015-12-15T13:05:55Z",  
"build_snapshot" : false,  
"lucene_version" : "5.3.1"  
},  
"tagline" : "You Know, for Search"  
}  
```
And if you want to stop and start again the container, just execute the next:
```sh  
$ docker stop elk  
elk
$ docker start elk  
elk  
```
**5) Sending a dummy logs to ELK**
In another terminal execute the next:
```sh  
$ docker exec -it elk /bin/bash
$ docker exec -it elk /bin/bash  
root@788b97b04e9b:/# /opt/logstash/bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost"] } }'  
Settings: Default filter workers: 1  
Logstash startup completed  
Hola Chilcano!!  
^CSIGINT received. Shutting down the pipeline. {:level=>:warn}
Logstash shutdown completed  
root@788b97b04e9b:/#  
```
In other terminal using cURL or from a browser:
```sh  
$ curl http://192.168.99.100:9200/_search?pretty  
{  
"took" : 5,  
"timed_out" : false,  
"_shards" : {  
"total" : 6,  
"successful" : 6,  
"failed" : 0  
},  
"hits" : {  
"total" : 2,  
"max_score" : 1.0,  
"hits" : [ {  
"_index" : ".kibana",  
"_type" : "config",  
"_id" : "4.3.1",  
"_score" : 1.0,  
"_source":{"buildNum":9517}  
}, {  
"_index" : "logstash-2016.01.14",  
"_type" : "logs",  
"_id" : "AVJA8Na_dQWajjStHmJN",  
"_score" : 1.0,  
"_source":{"message":"Hola Chilcano!!","@version":"1","@timestamp":"2016-01-14T16:21:11.231Z","host":"788b97b04e9b"}  
} ]  
}  
}  
```
... and from the Kibana web console (`http://192.168.99.100:5601`) to view the incoming dummy log event. Before configure Kibana by creating a `Index Pattern` with `logstash-*` and `Time-field name: @timestamp`, as shown below:

### 2\. Sending WSO2 logs to the ELK Docker container
For this part I will use a Vagrant box with several WSO2 products pre-installed and pre-configured. I explained how to use It in this blog, for further details check that post <https://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/creating-a-vm-with-wso2-servers-for-development>.

**1) Start the WSO2 Vagrant box**
```sh  
$ git clone https://github.com/chilcano/box-vagrant-wso2-dev-srv.git
$ cd box-vagrant-wso2-dev-srv
$ vagrant up  
```
```sh  
$ vagrant ssh

```
If you already are running this Vagrant box with WSO2 ESB, WSO2 API Manager, WSO2 DSS, Wiremock, etc. then the next step is configure It to send the different generated logs to ELK Docker Container.  
In the documentation explains that It will be used [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat), for that we have to install and configure Filebeat in this Vagrant box.
**2) Install Filebeat into Vagrant box**
```sh  
$ sudo curl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/filebeat/filebeat_1.0.1_i386.deb  
$ sudo dpkg -i filebeat_1.0.1_i386.deb  
$ sudo rm filebeat_1.0.1_i386.deb  
```
**3) Configure Filebeat to forward WSO2 logs to ELK Docker Container**
```sh  
$ ll /etc/filebeat/  
total 20  
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 814 Dec 17 13:26 filebeat.template.json  
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14541 Dec 17 13:26 filebeat.yml  
```
```sh  
$ sudo nano filebeat.yml
output:  
logstash:  
enabled: true  
hosts: ["elk-docker:5044"]  
timeout: 15  
tls:  
certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-beats.crt"]
filebeat:  
prospectors:

paths:  
\- /opt/wso2esb01a/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log  
\- /opt/wso2esb02a/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log  
\- /opt/wso2am02a/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log  
\- /opt/wso2dss01a/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log

level: warning  
to_files: true

keepfiles: 7
```
Where `elk-docker:5044` is the hostname for the `192.168.99.100` added to `/etc/hosts` of Vagrant box.
Copy the `/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-beats.crt` file from Logstash Beats input plugin (ELK Docker Container) into `/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-beats.crt` (Vagrant box).
```text  
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs/  
$ cd /etc/pki/tls/certs/  
$ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spujadas/elk-docker/master/nginx-filebeat/logstash-beats.crt

### or from ELK container SCP the *.crt file to Vagrant (open 2222 port).  
$ scp -P 2222 /etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-beats.crt vagrant@192.168.1.43:/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-beats.crt  
```
To avoid the below error, to update the `host` with a hostname (not IP address) as `elk-docker` in `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` file, after that update also `/etc/hosts` with the appropiate IP Address.
```sh  
$ sudo /etc/init.d/filebeat start  
2016/01/15 17:30:22.910725 transport.go:125: ERR SSL client failed to connect with: x509: cannot validate certificate for 192.168.99.100 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs  
```
**4) Loading the Index Template in Elasticsearch**
Before starting Filebeat for the first time, run this command to load the default index template in Elasticsearch from the Vagrant box:
```sh  
$ curl -XPUT 'http://192.168.99.100:9200/_template/filebeat?pretty' -d@/etc/filebeat/filebeat.template.json  
{  
"acknowledged" : true  
}  
```
**5) Start Filebeat daemon**
```sh  
$ sudo /etc/init.d/filebeat restart  
* Restarting Sends log files to Logstash or directly to Elasticsearch. filebeat  
2016/01/19 10:55:36.335563 beat.go:97: DBG Initializing output plugins

```
or if You have created `filebeat.yml` in a different folder.
```sh  
$ sudo ./filebeat -e -c /myfolder/filebeat.yml  
```
**6) Check if Filebeat is running**
I have created a `filebeat.yml` file with the logs section enabled. That's suitable to verify of everything is OK.
```sh  
$ sudo tail -10000f /var/log/filebeat/filebeat.log

```
The filebeat.log indicates that Filebeat daemon is sending the events to Logstash (ELK container).
**7) Viewing the raw log events from Kibana**
I am not filtering the log events, Logstash will be received the informations as it is.  
In a next blog post I will explain how to visualize the log events using filters, queries and graphs.
To view the raw log events, just open Kibana from a browser, in my case is in `http://192.168.99.100:5601`.  
Go to `Kibana &gt; Settings`, add and create a new `Index Pattern` using the next:  
* Index name or pattern : `filebeat-*` (instead of `logstash-*`)  
* Time-field name: `@timestamp`
After that, go to `Kibana &gt; Discover` and select the recently created `filebeat-*` Index Pattern and You will see your logs/events.
_Kibana - Viewing WSO2 and Wiremock raw log events_

In the above figure, a raw log event for WSO2 API Manager in JSON format is like as below:
```sh  
{  
"_index": "filebeat-2016.01.19",  
"_type": "log",  
"_id": "AVJZhXK2D7hOMrzuotcM",  
"_score": null,  
"_source": {  
"message": "TID: [0] [AM] [2016-01-19 10:54:12,666] INFO {org.wso2.carbon.core.internal.permission.update.PermissionUpdater} - Permission cache updated for tenant -1234 {org.wso2.carbon.core.internal.permission.update.PermissionUpdater}",  
"@version": "1",  
"@timestamp": "2016-01-19T10:54:16.057Z",  
"beat": {  
"hostname": "wso2-dev-srv-01",  
"name": "wso2-dev-srv-01"  
},  
"count": 1,  
"fields": null,  
"input_type": "log",  
"offset": 0,  
"source": "/opt/wso2am02a/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log",  
"type": "log",  
"host": "wso2-dev-srv-01"  
},  
"fields": {  
"@timestamp": [  
1453200856057  
]  
},  
"sort": [  
1453200856057  
]  
}  
```
As I said above, in a next blog post I will explain how to visualize the log events using filters to parse simple event and multiple events.
That's all.  
I hope you enjoyed it.
