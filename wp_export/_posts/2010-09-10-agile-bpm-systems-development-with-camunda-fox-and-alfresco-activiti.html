<p>Is Agile BPM systems development possible?. Yes, it is possible.</p>
<p>This is the main reason why I like Intalio BPMS (BPMN, BPEL, BRE, ESB/SOA, BAM/BI, ECM and Portal integration and Rich Web RAD with Tibco GI).<br />

Camunda Fox is "[...] an open source BPM platform. It helps you to build process-centric software solutions in Java." (http://fox.camunda.com)</p>
<p>Camunda explains its approach in this blogpost: <a title="Making the BPMN Roundtrip real" href="http://www.bpm-guide.de/2010/05/27/making-the-bpmn-roundtrip-real/">Making the BPMN Roundtrip real</a></p>
<p>Activiti is "[...] Activiti is a Business Process Management (BPM) and workflow system targeted at <a href="http://www.activiti.org/cycle.html">business people</a>, <a href="http://www.activiti.org/components.html#engine">developers</a> and <a href="http://www.activiti.org/components.html#probe">system admins</a>." (http://www.activiti.org)</p>
<p>Activiti Cycle is collaborative approach in BPMS: "[...] The Process Cycle Layer identifies the layer on which business stakeholders, developers and IT operations people collaborate." (http://www.activiti.org/cycle.html)</p>
<p>Now, Camunda Fox (Free/Open Source project) is integrating and aligning to Activiti Cycle (http://www.bpm-guide.de/2010/08/27/done-first-activiti-cycle-preview-out) .</p>
<p>On 1st of september, Activi 5.0.beta1 was released containing the first Camunda contribution! (http://processdevelopments.blogspot.com/2010/09/activiti-50beta1-rocks.html)</p>
<p>I will follow evolution of this interesting initiative and<span style="font-size:13.3333px;"> hope to write soon on this and even maybe a comparison with the Intalio BPMS approach.</span></p>
