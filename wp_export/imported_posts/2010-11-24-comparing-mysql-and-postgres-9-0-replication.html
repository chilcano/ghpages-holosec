<h2>Comparing MySQL and Postgres 9.0 Replication</h2>
<p><em>By Robin Schumacher and Gary Carter, www.enterprisedb.com</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Replication is one of the most popular features used in RDBMSâ€™s today. Replication is used for disaster recovery purposes (i.e. backup or warm stand-by servers), reporting systems where query activity is offloaded onto another machine to conserve resources on the transactional server, and scale-out architectures that use sharding or other methods to increase overall query performance and data throughput.</p>
<p>Replication is not restricted to only the major proprietary databases; open source databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL also offer replication as a feature. While MySQL has offered built-in replication for a number of years, PostgreSQL replication used to be accomplished via community software that was an add-on to the core Postgres Server. That all changed with the release of version 9.0 of PostgreSQL, which now offers built-in streaming replication that is based on its proven write ahead log technology.</p>
<p>With the two most popular open source databases now providing built-in replication, questions are being asked about how they differ in their replication technologies. What follows is a brief overview of both MySQL and PostgreSQL replication, with a brief compare and contrast of the implementations being performed immediately afterwards.</p>
