<p><strong>Jerome Saltzer and Michael Schroeder in "The Protection of Information in Computer Systems"</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"[...] <strong>Psychological acceptability</strong>: It is essential that the human interface be designed for ease of use, so that users routinely and automatically apply the protection mechanisms correctly. Also, to the extent that the user's mental image of his protection goals matches the mechanisms he must use, mistakes will be minimized. If he must translate his image of his protection needs into a radically different specification language, he will make errors. [..]"</p></blockquote>
<p>Any question?</p>
