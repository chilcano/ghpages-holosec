I am a software professional with over 15 years of experience in designing and implementing a wide variety of critical systems in diferent industries.

Based in UK and Spain, I deliver independent consulting, helping clients solve their problems using and applying open source technology to address complex system integrations.

I help clients to design a path forward towards Microservices Architecture, Cloud Architecture, API-centric and SOA, DevOps and Security practices.

An architect who codes, a consultant who dig deeply in the issues to solve them. My specialities include working at low level with the technology in a client facing environment, consultancy and training services, with emphasis in __Security__, using __open source technologies__ and applying the best practices and new approaches, like [Systems Thinking](http://holisticsecurity.io/2007/10/29/holistic-system-security-an-cyber-security-research-priority/), [Holism](http://holisticsecurity.io/2008/06/13/what-is-holism/), etc.

I blog regularly on software and architecture best practices, security and share my proof-of-concepts and tools with the open source community. I like to speak, write, present in public and exchange and sharing ideas. I hope this [site](http://holisticsecurity.io) illustrates that.
