1. PCAP2SQL - A tool for converting pcap files to a set of relational database tables
https://code.google.com/p/pcap2sql

2. Suricata - An Network IDS, IPS, Network Security Monitoring engine Open Source.
http://suricata-ids.org

3. Moloch - An open source large scale IPv4 full PCAP capturing, indexing and database system.
https://github.com/aol/moloch

4. Snort - An open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS).
http://www.snort.org

5. Bro -  A powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know.
http://www.bro.org

6. Security Onion - A Linux distro for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management. It's based on Ubuntu and contains Snort, Suricata, Bro, OSSEC, Sguil, Squert, Snorby, ELSA, Xplico, NetworkMiner, and many other security tools.

7. NetworkMiner - a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows (but also works in Linux / Mac OS X / FreeBSD). NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files.

8. Squert - A web application that is used to query and view event data stored in a Sguil database (typically IDS alert data). 
http://www.squertproject.org

9. Snorby - Ruby On Rails Application For Network Security Monitoring.
Integrates with intrusion detection systems like Snort, Suricata and Sagan

11. WinPcap -  is the industry-standard tool for link-layer network access in Windows environments
http://www.winpcap.org

12. Tcpreplay - Pcap editing and replaying utilities
http://tcpreplay.appneta.com

13. ELSA - A centralized syslog framework built on Syslog-NG, MySQL, and Sphinx full-text search.

14. Android PCAP - a utility for capturing raw 802.11 frames (“Monitor mode”, or sometimes referred to as “Promiscuous mode”). The resulting Pcap files can be viewed on a computer using Eye P.A., Wireshark, Tcpdump and similar tools, or online using CloudShark.
Android PCAP works with Android phones running version 4 (ICS) or higher and Wi-Fi cards that use the RTL 8187 chipset.

15. Kismet - an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and (with appropriate hardware) can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n traffic.

Devices:

1. HackRF - Transmit or receive any radio signal from 30 MHz to 6000 MHz on USB power with HackRF.

2. Kisbee - A project to create a small, battery powered, open source hardware device for capturing 802.15.4 (aka Zigbee).
Kisbee gets approximately 20 hours runtime on a 1000MAh battery, in receive mode.
