__Minimum Viable Security__ (MVSec) is a concept borrowed from the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product){:target="_blank"} (MVP) concept about the Product Development Strategy and from the [Pareto Principle or 80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle){:target="_blank"}. The MVP concept applied to IT Security means the product (application) will contain only the minimum amount (20%) of effort invested in order to prove the viability (80%) of an idea (acceptable security). 

The purpose of this post is to explain how to implement __TLS everywhere__ to become __MVSec__ (roughly 80% of security with 20% of working) for a __Kubernetised Webapp hosted on AWS__.

## Why _TLS everywhere_ meets 80/20 rule?

Part of the answer gives us Vilfredo Pareto with the Pareto Principle, but to have a complete answer we have to turn to The Security Design Principles that NIST, OWASP, NCSC and other Security References give us.

There are many similarities between them at fundamental level, let's explore the OWASP for example and do a quick analysis to see how TLS can help us to meet these Security Principles.

OWASP Security Design Principles| Explanation                   | How to TLS help us?
---                             | ---                           | ---
1) Defense in Depth.            | Also known as layered defense.| TLS over HTTP provides a new secure layer.
2) Fail Safe.                   | Unless a subject is given explicit access to an object, it should be denied access to that object. | TLS Certificates can encrypt at rest and in transit these objects.
3) Least Privilege.             | A Process is given only the minimum level of access rights (privileges) that is necessary for that Process to complete an assigned operation. | Transit of sensitive objects must be over TLS.
4) Separation of Duties.        | Also known as the [compartmentalization principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(information_security)), or separation of privilege. | HTTPS is for sensitive transactions and HTTP for non-sensitive.
5) Economy of Mechanism.        | Also known as [Keep It Simple, Stupid principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). | The accepted and supported [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) includes TLS by default. So, if HTTP is insecure, why is it still being used?.
6) Complete Mediation.          | All accesses to objects must be checked to ensure that they are allowed. | TLS provides Simple and [Mutual (Two-Way) Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) and allways once crypto keys have been verified a secure communication is stablished. 
7) Open Design.                 | The security of a mechanism should not depend on the secrecy of its design or implementation. | The disclosure of TLS' using in software designs don't put in risk the application.
8) Least Common Mechanism       | It disallows the sharing of mechanisms that are common to more than one user or process if the users and processes are at different levels of privilege. | TLS is a common secure mechanism shared along the application.
9) Psychological acceptability. | Tries maximizing the usage and adoption of the security functionality in the application by making it more usable. | TLS is a feature by default in HTTP/2. HTTP requires implement TLS and deal the crypto keys.  
10) Weakest Link.               | The resiliency of your software against hacker attempts will depend heavily on the protection of its weakest components. | TLS helps to harden the access to resources and secure the traffic.
11) Leveraging Existing Components. | It focuses on ensuring that the attack surface is not increased. | TLS is a feature by default in HTTP/2 for securing data in transit and data at rest, don't try to bring or implement your own _TLS_.

If this quick analysis does not convince you, then refer to the Pillars of Security, they are axioms and don't require be demostration.
Organization like OWASP recommends that all security controls should be designed with the __Core pillars of Information Security__ in mind:

Pillar of Security | Description                                                                   | TLS ?
---                | ---                                                                           | ---
1. Confidentiality | Only allow access to data for which the user is permitted.                    | Access Control(*) using TLS and Mutual TLS Authn.
2. Integrity       | Ensure data is not tampered or altered by unauthorised users.                 | Data no altered using TLS(*) encryption at rest.
3. Availability    | Ensure systems and data are available to authorised users when they need it.  | Mutual TLS Authn(*) helps to availability only to authorised users.

> (*) These Axioms refer to _access control_, _data no altered_, _unauthorised users_, etc. and that is implemented following the [Identity-based Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity-based_security) Strategy.

## Let's implement TLS everywhere in Kubernetes.

### Create an Kubernetes Cluster


**1) Clone the Affordable K8s Cluster Git Repo and run the Terraform scripts**

I'll create a Kubernetes Cluster with this configuration:

- NGINX Ingress Controller will be deployed as `DaemonSet` (in the namespace `ingress-nginx`) with `hostNetwork: true` to ensure the NGINX server is reachable from all K8s Cluster nodes.
  * When a pod is configured with `hostNetwork: true`, the applications running in such a pod can directly see the network interfaces of the host machine where the pod was started.
  * Further information in the [`nginx-ingress-mandatory.yaml` deployment file](https://github.com/chilcano/affordable-k8s/blob/master/manifests/nginx-ingress-mandatory.yaml).
- Custom Domain Name System (DNS) is `cloud.holisticsecurity.io` and the Ingress Subdomain DNS is `ingress-nginx.cloud.holisticsecurity.io`.
- TLS Cert enabled using Jetstack Cert-Manager and Let's Encrypt.
- `NodePort` Service for the NGINX Ingress Controller. See its [configuration](https://github.com/chilcano/affordable-k8s/blob/master/manifests/nginx-ingress-nodeport.yaml.tmpl) here.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/chilcano/affordable-k8s
$ cd affordable-k8s

$ terraform init

$ terraform plan \
  -var cluster_name="cheapk8s" \
  -var k8s_ssh_key="ssh-key-for-us-east-1" \
  -var admin_cidr_blocks="83.45.101.2/32" \
  -var region="us-east-1" \
  -var kubernetes_version="1.14.3" \
  -var external_dns_enabled="1" \
  -var nginx_ingress_enabled="1" \
  -var nginx_ingress_domain="ingress-nginx.cloud.holisticsecurity.io" \
  -var cert_manager_enabled="1" \
  -var cert_manager_email="cheapk8s@holisticsecurity.io"

$ terraform apply \
  -var cluster_name="cheapk8s" \
  -var k8s_ssh_key="ssh-key-for-us-east-1" \
  -var admin_cidr_blocks="83.45.101.2/32" \
  -var region="us-east-1" \
  -var kubernetes_version="1.14.3" \
  -var external_dns_enabled="1" \
  -var nginx_ingress_enabled="1" \
  -var nginx_ingress_domain="ingress-nginx.cloud.holisticsecurity.io" \
  -var cert_manager_enabled="1" \
  -var cert_manager_email="cheapk8s@holisticsecurity.io"
```

**2) Once the K8s Cluster is created, check if NGINX Ingress Controller is running correctly**

Let's make a query to The NGINX Ingress Controller's NodePort Service. Likely you have to wait a 2-3 minutes till the Cluster is running completely.

```sh
$ ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output master_dns) -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem

$ kubectl get pod,svc -n ingress-nginx -o wide
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/default-http-backend-5c9bb94849-9lpn9   1/1     Running   0          7m35s
pod/nginx-ingress-controller-r2j8t          1/1     Running   0          7m34s
pod/nginx-ingress-controller-v22mp          1/1     Running   0          7m34s

NAME                           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
service/default-http-backend   ClusterIP   10.110.233.145   <none>        80/TCP                       7m36s
service/ingress-nginx          NodePort    10.111.197.179   <none>        80:30002/TCP,443:30414/TCP   7m33s
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should get a `default backend - 404` response when accessing the NGINX Ingress Controller using its `NodePort` and its `external IP address`. This tells us that the controller doesnâ€™t know where to route the request to, so responds with the default backend.

Calling it from inside the K8s Cluster, here you have to use the `NodePorts` (`30002` for HTTP and `30414` for HTTPS):
```sh
$ curl http://localhost:30002/abc
default backend - 404

$ curl https://localhost:30414/pqr -k
default backend - 404
```

And calling from Internet, here you have to use Standard Ports (`80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS) and the `external IP address`:
```sh
$ curl http://ingress-nginx.cloud.holisticsecurity.io/abc
default backend - 404

$ curl https://ingress-nginx.cloud.holisticsecurity.io/pqr -k
default backend - 404
```


### Deploying a Sample Application

### Enabling and configuring TLS everywhere




## Conclusions

1. At operationaly speaking, TLS management is expensive, that means:
   - Manage the TLS Certificates Lifecycle: revocation, renewals, validation, etc.
2.
