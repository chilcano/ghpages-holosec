__Minimum Viable Security__ (MVSec) is a concept borrowed from the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product){:target="_blank"} (MVP) concept about the Product Development Strategy and from the [Pareto Principle or 80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle){:target="_blank"}. The MVP concept applied to IT Security means the product (application) will contain only the minimum amount (20%) of effort invested in order to prove the viability (80%) of an idea (acceptable security). 

The purpose of this post is to explain how to implement __TLS everywhere__ to become __MVSec__ (roughly 80% of security with 20% of working) for a __Kubernetised Webapp hosted on AWS__.

## Why _TLS everywhere_ meets 80/20 rule?

Part of the answer gives us Vilfredo Pareto with the Pareto Principle, but to have a complete answer we have to turn to The Security Design Principles.
There are many sets of Security Design Principles, for example:
- Viega & McGraw (10)
- OWASP (10)
- [Systems Security Engineering by NIST, SP 800-160 Vol. 1, updated 21/Mar/2018](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1/final):
  * There are 32 principles.
- [Secure Design Principles by NCSC, version 1.0, updated 21/May/2019](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-security-design-principles): 
  * There are 31 and 15 principles in total.
- [Cliff Bergâ€™s Principles for High-Assurance Design (Architecting Secure and Reliable Enterprise Applications), 23/October/2005](https://www.amazon.com/High-Assurance-Design-Architecting-Enterprise-Applications/dp/0321793277), etc.
  
Many similarities between them at fundamental level
